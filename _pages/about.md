I lead the shopping product tracking team at Microsoft AI. I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science from Purdue University. Before joining Microsoft, I was a Research engineer at IBM, working in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, and machine translation. My current work focuses on building large-scale data -centric products that utilize various artificial intelligence techniques to deliver value to users.
