The <em>experience</em> is the <strong>training data</strong> that the filter is trained on. The goal of machine learning is to improve the performance of a task by learning from experience. In the case of the spam filter, the goal is to improve the accuracy of the filter by learning from training data.</p> <p>Machine learning is suitable for the following problems</p> <ul> <li>Require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules.</li> <li>Complex where traditional methods do not work well.</li> <li>Fluctuating over time where the data changes frequently.</li> </ul> <p>The alternative to machine learning is <strong>hand-crafted rules</strong>. For example, a spam filter could be built by hand-crafting rules such as:</p> <ul> <li>If the email contains the word “coupon”, then it is spam.</li> <li>If the email is from a known spammer, then it is spam.</li> <li>If the email is from a friend, then it is not spam.</li> </ul> <p>The problem with hand-crafted rules is that they are <strong>brittle</strong>. For example, if the word “coupon” is replaced with “koupon”,then the rule will not work. Machine learning is more robust because it learns which words are associated with spam from the data.</p> <h2 id="components">Components</h2> <p>The three major components of a machine learning system are:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://amgadmadkour.com/notes/ml/concept/data">Data</a></li> <li><a href="http://amgadmadkour.com/notes/ml/concept/model">Model</a></li> <li><a href="http://amgadmadkour.com/notes/ml/concept/learning">Learning</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="types-of-learning">Types of Learning</h2> <p>There are several ways to categorize machine learning algorithms. One way is to categorize them by the type of learning they use.
